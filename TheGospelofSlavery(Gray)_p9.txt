G Stands for Gospel. How beautiful are
The feet of the bearer of news from afar,
When coming to touch a humanity-chord
And preach the acceptable year of the Lord!
Set free the scourged bondman, now branded and sore,
And write him a freeman, a man evermore,
Around whom a family closely may draw.
â€”-Or if the Good Gospel be Slavery Law,
The clergy, for aught that to reason appears,
Might honestly prosper as Slave Auctioneers!


Why not? Disrespect is intended for such clergymen only as
put Southern Slavery on Bible grounds. They might sell
books, shoes, horses, by public outcry, and feel no shame of
sin. If the Gospel endorses colored people as property, why
should the clergy scruple to be Slave-Auctioneers? Bishop
Hopkins, of Vermont, might do a thriving business in that line,
down South. Doubtless he is popular in that region, and
would be largely patronized!
