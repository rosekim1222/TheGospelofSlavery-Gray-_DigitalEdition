V Stands for Victory. Villainy long,
“The sum of all villainies,” prospered in wrong;
But when it uplifted the bloody red hand,
The verdict was sealed of its doom in the land.
Poor whites in the South by aristocrats bowed,
And millions of bondmen are crying aloud;
And Freedom’s renown, and Humanity’s need,
Alike for a LIBERTY-VICTORY plead;
And triumph and peace shall thro’ righteousness come,
When Slavery dies and its pleaders are dumb.


Even when Fort Sumter was environed by threatening Rebel
batteries, there was a spirit of compromise in all the land; but
the first gun aimed at the Flag of Liberty was "the beginning
of the end” of Slavery. The Star Spangled Banner of our fa-
thers, that had long floated in honor and triumph, was trodden
down and trailed in the dust by miscreant-traitors; and it must
yet be vindicated and exalted in righteousness, though it be
through blood and fire.
