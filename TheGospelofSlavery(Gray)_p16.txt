N Stands for Negro. To be all he can,
Without doing wrong, is the birth-right of man,
And noblest humanity evermore lies
In prompting and helping the lowly to rise.
Are Slaves dull and ignorant? Multitudes are:
Shall therefore the Master improvement debar?
Yet if to instruct them you open your mouth,
Beware of the penalty, down in the South!
â€”-Can that be of God which for Slavery greed
Forbids you to teach a poor Negro to read?


Whether the African race, now in bondage in the South, be
or be not in a better condition than their kindred in Africa,
need not here be discussed. Morality and religion inquire, sim-
ply, whether Southern laws encourage an advancement? Do
they not rather hinder, by severe penalties, any efforts to edu-
cate the slave population? Public Schools are the pride and
glory of the North: What is the boast and shame of the
South?
