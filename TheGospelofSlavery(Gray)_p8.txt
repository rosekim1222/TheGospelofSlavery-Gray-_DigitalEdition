F stands for Fugitives hasting from wrath,
And furies are hot on their dangerous path.
Away from the cabins of slavery pomp,
A refuge they seek in the hideous swamp;
Or, haply eluding the hunters of blood,
They struggle through thicket and perilous flood,
Till, reaching the lines of the Union Host,
The echo has died of the scandalous boast,
"Hurra for the banner that Liberty waves,
“With stars for the Masters and stripes for the Slaves!”


A history of this Liberty War would be very incomplete with-
out sample-sketches of the patient, shrewd efforts of individuals
and families of Slaves in getting away from the house of
bondage into the lines of the Union Army. Almost starved,
hunted by dogs and men, shot at, some of the party killed,--
none but the good Lord knoweth the miseries endured by
thousands in escaping from the comfortable, patriarchal, Gospel
institution of the South!
