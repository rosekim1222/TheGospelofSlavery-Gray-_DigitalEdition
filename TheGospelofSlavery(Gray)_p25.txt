W Stands for Woman. In Slavery-life,
Full many are mothers, but no one is wife.
For decency’s sake, form of wedding there is,
But the parties are claimed by the master as his;
And the children are sold, and the father is sold
To this or that trader, “to have and to hold;”
And the woman is whipped, for the motherly moan
And the cry of a heart that is left all alone.
O master all monstrous! is conscience amiss
In dooming the sham of a wedding like this!


Certain Southern ladies claimed, not long since, that they
care as tenderly for slave mothers as Northern ladies care for
poor white mothers. "Possibly that is true,” was the reply,
"but Northern ladies do not afterwards sell the baby!’—-Besides
this, it is the money-interest of Southerners to look well to the
increase of their property, whereas a true humanity, as a princi-
ple, underlies and quickens the charitable attention of Northern
ladies, above referred to.
