P Stands for Principle. Policy fain
Would measure all deeds by the loss or the gain,
While Principle never finds aught to consult
But conscience and duty, whate'er the result.
In Slaveholding policy, all that you win
May fitly be reckoned the wages of sin,
And what has been earned by the master or thrall,
Is never withheld by the Ruler of All.
Perhaps you will learn, when the payment is due,
That a deed which is wrong is impolitic too.


In 1786 Washington expressed his determination never to
"possess another slave by purchase.” Avowed in 1794 that he
held slaves "very reluctantly to his own feelings.” By will
emancipated all he held, making provision for the support of the
aged and infirm, and for the education of the young-—and most
solemnly enjoined his executors to see that his instructions were
religiously fulfilled. According to the Slavery propagandists of
this age of grace, all this was fundamentally wrong!
