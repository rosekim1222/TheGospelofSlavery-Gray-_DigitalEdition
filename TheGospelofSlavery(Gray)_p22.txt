T Stands for Trader. To call him a brute
Would slander creation, beyond a dispute.
The Planter will mingle and socially dine
With dealers in cotton, and cattle, and swine,
But Slave-driving Traders (with common accord)
By Slave-holding gentry are shunned and abhorred!
Does conscience, with scruples of right, intervene
Concerning a business repugnantly mean?
Yet whoso shall doubt, may the difference tell:
What we rightfully buy, we may honestly sell.


The world moves, slowly it may be, but surely. Russia
abolished Serfdom by an imperial decree, and our Republic is
cutting a tangled knot by the edge of the sword. The loathing
with which the Slave Trader has long been regarded, even in the
South, was the index-finger of the hand of God. It is now a
voice sounding in the darkness as a prophecy of coming day.
Will not angels join the chorus of welcome? May the good
Lord hasten the hour of deliverance.
