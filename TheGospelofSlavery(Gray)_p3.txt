A Stands for Adam. Creation began
By giving dominion of Nature to man.
Men differ in color, and stature, and weight,
Nor equal are all in their talent or state,
But equal in rights are the great and the small
In sight of the God and Creator of all.
Then how comes dominion of brother by brother?
Or how can the one be the lord of the other?
Consider it well--for an answer I crave,
That reaches the question of Master and Slave.


"We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are 
created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with cer-
tain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness." -Decl. Of Ind. It is nothing to affirm
that the Negro, or Indian, or Arab, is not equal to the white
man--namely, in talent and the like. No two white men are
equal in all respects--but if you deny an equality of rights, spe-
cify the grounds of such denial
