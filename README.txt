	As I began organizing the photos of all the pages, I noticed three key features on each page: one drawing, one enlarged capital letter, and a line separating a short paragraph of text that was either a quotation or an opinion. With this in mind, I organized my metadata by sorting the pages by their page numbers to establish a chronological order. I then labeled each page according to its notable content, as each was dedicated to a letter of the alphabet and conveyed a new theme. The keywords represent the word that each letter stands for, along with additional words describing the page’s content to give readers a general idea of what the page is about. Each page also included drawings, which were vital in conveying the author’s message and visualizing the themes and ideas. There were also quotes at the bottom of each page that explained the poetic content. Knowing the author or source of each quote could provide additional details and context to help readers fully understand the page.  

	Using Homebrew and tesseract, I was able to extract and clean the data from The Gospel of Slavery with minimal revisions. This software was overall able to OCR the text on clean pages well; however, the software made nonsensical errors from discoloration or rips on certain pages. Words with different font, bolding, or italicization were either completely ignored or written as random symbols, and images entirely couldn't be transcribed. There was also evidence of the book resisting digitization when dust or small markings made the software misinterpret letters. Despite the general formatting of each page being the same, the system failed to keep a consistently-formatted transcription, making the pages require more revisions.
