 I chose to first sort the pages by their page numbers to assign a chronological order to the book. I then signified each page to its notable content, as each page was dedicated to a letter of the alphabet and conveyed a new theme. The keywords are for the word that each letter stands for with other additional words that describe the contents of the page, providing readers a general idea of what the page is about. Each page also had illustrations, which was vital in conveying the author's message while drawing a picture for the themes and its ideas. There were also quotes at the bottom of each page that explained the poetic contents of each page. Knowing the author or where the quote came from could provide additional details and context that the reader should know about in order to fully understand the page.
