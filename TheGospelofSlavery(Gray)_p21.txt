S Stands for Slavery. Nations of old
Made bondmen by warfare, or bought them with gold;
And if to the Jews you incline to go back,
No special enslavement you find of the black.
But “might is not right,” as in piracy scenes,
Else why do you censure the stern Algerines?
Or what if in Congo a thousand white men
Were Slaves, wholly hopeless of freedom again,--
Would bishops and priests of the Slavery line,
Quote Bible to prove it both right and divine?


"Slavery and the Slave Trade pervaded every nation of civil-
ized antiquity....The founder of the Jewish nation was a Slaye-
holder....Greeks enslaved each other....The Slave-markets of
Rome were filled with men of every complexion and every |
clime....It is from about the year 990 that regular accounts of
the Negro Slave-trade exist.”—-Bancroft’s United States, i. 159.
Any Bible argument for Slavery must therefore except the black,
if any color is to be excepted!
