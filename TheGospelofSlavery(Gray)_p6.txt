D Stands for Driver. His duty, I hear,
Is mostly described as the Slave-Overseer.
O tell me, I pray you, if any one can,
If planters acknowledge the brute as a man!
With whip and with pistols, the vagabond wields
The law of the Master in hovels and fields,
But scarcely removed, in a social degree,
Above the rude gang that he governs is he,
And, like the Slave Trader, his service is prized
As treason is loved, and the traitor despised!


Some persons sneer at any distinction between hirelings of a
month or year and hirelings for life-—the latter being their
definition of Southern Slavery! A taste of the wormwood and
the gall might bring them to exclaim with Sterne: "Disguise
thyself as thou wilt, still Slavery, still thou art a bitter draught;
and though thousands in all ages have been made to drink of
thee, thou art no less bitter on that account.” Suppose the
chalice were commended to the lips of Slaveholders?
