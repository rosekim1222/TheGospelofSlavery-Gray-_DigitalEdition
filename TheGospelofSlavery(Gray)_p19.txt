Q Stands for Query. Inquisitive thought
May lead to conclusions not anxiously sought.
Suppose of Quadroon we a moment should think,
With one side of ancestry sable as ink,
The other side claiming complexion as fair
As fatherly planters most commonly wear:
The child of her Master, a Slave-daughter still,
Must bow to the law of his sensual will;
And when he shall sell her, (perhaps very soon)
The Query may follow the chattel Quadroon.


The cry of "amalgamation‚Äù as the result of the abolition of
Slavery, comes with a very ill grace from Southerners. How
many nearly-white children have been sent to the North for an
education, or to hide their negro-blood? How many such have
been manumitted, to guard against their continuance in bondage
by any mishap? How many Quadroons have been sold volun-
tarily or brought to the block by the pecuniary embarrassments
of their father-masters?
