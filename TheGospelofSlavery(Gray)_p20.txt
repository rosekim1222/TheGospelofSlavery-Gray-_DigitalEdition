R Stands for Rebel. The Colonies rose
Against the stern sway of tyrannical foes,
But Washington, Jefferson, all were ignored,
When Southerners lifted the sceptre and sword,
And Slavery lust to Rebellion gave birth
Against the best government known in the earth.
Did Rebeldom look to the shame and the cost
Of seeking by war the control they had lost?
Or know they how ages will reckon the guilt
Of a Temple of Freedom on Slavery built?


"The foundations of our new government are laid, its corner-
stone rests upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to
the white man. . . . This, our new government, is the first in
the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philoso-
phical and moral truth. . . . This stone which was rejected by
the first builders, is become the chief stone of the corner in our
new edifice. . . . Our Confederacy is a God-sent missionary to
the nations.” —Alexander H. Stephens.
