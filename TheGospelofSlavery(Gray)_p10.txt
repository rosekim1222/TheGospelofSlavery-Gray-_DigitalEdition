H Stands for Harvest. We reap as we sow:
If thistles you plant, do you know what will grow?
Enlarge your plantations, and multiply slaves,
Till luxury gets what it wrongfully craves,â€”-
Yet woe be to him who the inquiry scorns,
Do grapes grow on brambles or figs upon thorns?
Consider it well, ere the summer be past,
And the harvest be ended, with gloom at the last
And ever this adage in memory keep,
Who sows to the wind, of the whirlwind shall reap.


The evils of Slavery to the white race, in a material sense, are
clearly shown by statistics; but no one can reckon the low estate
of education, religion, and morals, especially in the country-
districts of the South. The larger the plantations are, the wider
is the space between the white families; and an increase of the
number of slaves, is no increase of exalting social intercourse.
The mansion cannot escape the malaria of the hovels, nor can
any one escape the just judgment of the Almighty.
