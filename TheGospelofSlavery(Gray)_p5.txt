C Stands for Cotton. Its beautiful bolls,
And bales of rich value, the Master controls.
Of “mud-sills” he prates, and would haughtily bring
The world to acknowledge that “Cotton is King.”
But “Democrat Coal” and “Republican Corn,”
The locks of the monarch have latterly shorn;
And Slaveocrats, living by clamorous fraud,
By Freemen shall yet into learning be awed,
That the sceptre is not in position nor gift,
But only in honest, industrial thrift.


"What is the difficulty, and what the remedy? Not in the
election of Republican Presidents. No. Not in the non-execu-
tion of the Fugitive bill. No. But it lies back of all these. It
is found in the Atheistic Red Republican doctrine of the Declara-
tion of Independence. Until that is trampled under feet, there
can be no peace.” --Dr. Smyth, a Rebel leader in South Carolina.
"Mud-sills” and "poor white trash” seem not to his liking; but
what if they should trample him under feet?
