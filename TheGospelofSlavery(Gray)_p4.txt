B Stands for Bloodhound. On merciless fangs
The Slaveholder feels that his "property‚Äù hangs,
And the dog and the master are hot on the track,
To torture or bring the black fugitive back.
The weak has but fled from the hand of the strong,
Asserting the right and resisting the wrong,
While he who exults in a skin that is white,
A Bloodhound employs in asserting his might.
--O chivalry-layman and dogmatist-priest,
Say, which is the monster--the man, or the beast?


How long is it since Southern papers advertised the offers of
rival hunters of fugitive Negroes, who claimed that they had the
best bloodhounds, &c. ? Truly an honorable and manly voca-
tion. Runaway Slaves were advertised as having been torn by
the dogs, thus and so, on former occasions of flight, and large
rewards were offered for the capture of such ingrates, dead or
alive! Shall not specimens of these advertisements be some day
included in the literary curiosities of civilization?
