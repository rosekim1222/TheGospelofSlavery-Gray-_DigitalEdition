K Stands for Kidnapper. Whoso receives
What others have stolen, is leagu’d with the thieves.
But setting aside what this proverb reveals,
The Slaveholder breeds what the Kidnapper steals!
Distinction there is, and a difference too—-
But which, if you chose, would be chosen by you?
To buy, or to sell, involves profit or waste—-
To breed, or to steal, is a question of taste;
And whoso does either, a business may claim
That perfects in meanness the sin and the shame!


What odds to the buyer whether the chattel has been kidnap-
ped or bought by the Trader? In one sense, there is something
manly (because risk of life is incurred), in taking prisoners in
war and making slaves of them; but kidnapping is unmitigated
villainy. How then can we sufficiently express abhorrence of
the men who make a business of breeding slaves for the mar-
ket? Doubtless, they are all, all honorable men, and worthily
accounted the chivalry of the land!
