J Stands for Justice. Whoe’er a man is,
Proclaim and defend what is rightfully his.
Content yourself not with his lawful demands,
Nor harden the links of his slavery-bands;
For all institutions are born of the dust
Which conscience declares to be wrong and unjust.
—-Will God in his majesty look to the hue
In making award of the recompense due?
Or will he in judgment be heedless or slack,
For justice withheld from the ignorant black?


"Your gold and silver is cankered, and the rust of them shall
be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire.
.... Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down
your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth; and the
cries of them which have reaped, are entered into the ears of
the Lord of Sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth,
and been wanton: ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of
slaughter.” -James v. 1—3.
