L Stands for Liberty. Know you the bell
That ’76 sounded so nobly and well?
Or know you that soon was developed a flaw,
By Freedom’s assertion of Slavery Law?
“Created all equal.”—-“Excepting the black,”
From States of the Union the answer came back.
Then cracked the big bell. Vainly chipped to the core,
No “compromise measures” its tone could restore,
And the prophecy stands, though the bell, in its fall,
Now silently hangs in Old Liberty Hall!


The bell referred to, cast in 1753, has on it the inscription,
"Proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants
thereof.”—-Lev. xxv. 10. Was this a prophecy? That bell an-
nounced the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was af-
terwards cracked—-I know not the date. Occasional use on na-
tional anniversaries increased the difficulty. Chipping, so as to
separate the vibrating edges, failed to remedy the mischief. It
now hangs in Independence Hall.
