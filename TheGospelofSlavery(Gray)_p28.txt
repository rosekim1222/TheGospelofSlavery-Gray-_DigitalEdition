Z Stands for Zenith. Though hell from beneath
Much struggle and suffering yet may bequeath,
The fee of the earth we shall trustfully claim
At Liberty’s shrine, in Humanity’s name.
The spots of the leopard shall token no sin—-
No crime shall be charged to the Ethiop’s skin—-
And, evermore radiant, the zenith shall glow,
The light and the joy of creation below—-
For perished shall then be the Slavery rod,
And man stand erect in the image of God.


"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert
a highway for our God. Every valley shall be exalted, and ev-
ery mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall
be made straight, and the rough places plain; and the glory of
the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together;
for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.”—-Isaiah xl. 3—5.

Thy Kingdom Come, O Lord our God!
