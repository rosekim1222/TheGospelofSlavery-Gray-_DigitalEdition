I Stands for Infidel. Many contemn
What you and I hold, as a riddle to them;
And sceptics are made (it is mournfully true)
By priests in the pulpit and saints in the pew,
Who torture the Gospel to get at the proof
That one man is made for another’s behoof!
The Bible comes not with its quickening light,
Till conscience and reason interpret aright,
And vainly you moan o’er the infidel fruit
While nourishing faith in the Slavery-root.


The creed should be better than the man; but what if the
man be better than the creed? Business relations with the
South, or friends residing there, or political clanship, may so
blind men to the hideous conjunction of the Gospel and South-
ern Slavery, that they may profess to believe in both; but reli-
gionists grieve the Holy Spirit and chiefly make Infidels, by
fastenining any inhuman institution or abominable theory on the
Word of God.
