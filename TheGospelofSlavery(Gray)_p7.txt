E Stands for Eagle. In Liberty springs
The strength of his beak-and the pride of his wings
Though vultures still cloud the political sky,
And “carrion, more carrion!” incessantly cry,
Shall Slave-craft prevail, and the moralist nod
O’er evils reserved in the judgment of God?
—-The Eagle has come to the rescue of right,
And all institutions of fraudulent might,
Shall perish and cease from the bountiful clime,
Long cursed by the stench of a carrion-crime!


The Constitution grants neither right nor authority to inter-
fere with the domestic institutions of any State; but Congress,
representing the people and the States, has absolute control in
the Territories. "More Slavery!” has been the continual cry
of the South. Rebellion provoked the war-power of the Pres-
ident; and it is now probable that the institution which claimed
a continent, will be numbered with the abominations that were!
Let all the people say Amen.
