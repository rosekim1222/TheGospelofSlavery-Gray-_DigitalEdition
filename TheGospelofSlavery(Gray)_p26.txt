X Stands for Cross. By the lusts of the flesh
Men open the wounds of the Saviour afresh,
And live for the gain that is nothing but loss,
If leading away from the blood of the Cross.
Yet many there are who deliverance mock,
And corner-stone make of a Slave Trader’s block.
Ignoring the grace of the One who was priced,
By daily oppression they crucify Christ,
And turn a deaf ear to the spirit that cried,
Shall the weak brother perish for whom the Lord died?


Setting aside all controversy as to the meaning or efficacy of
the sacrifice of Christ, it is clear that he died for all, tasted
death for every man, gave himself a ransom for all, without
distinction of color, character, station or creed. Whatever
allowance the Lord may make for sins of ignorance, can the
great God look with complacency on any people who by Slavery
count the blood of the covenant an unholy thing, and do despite
unto the spirit of grace?-—Hebrews x. 26—31.
